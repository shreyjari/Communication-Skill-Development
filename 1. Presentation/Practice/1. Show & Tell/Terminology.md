@John Jejen  
I feel like the terminology is getting confusing. Let's go with the following. If I miss one, let me know:

- **Target:** Expected Billable hours per month
- **Actual Hours:** Hours worked/submitted in a timesheet
- Commitment: Hours expected on a job
- Proposed Commitment: Committed hours on a project in the planned status
- Target Utilization: comparison between actual hours and target hours
- Commitment Utilization: comparison between actual hours and committed hours
- Target Availability: Indicate how much capacity remains for each resource against the target, It can be Over or Under
- Full-Time Availability: Indicate how much capacity each resource has against Full-Time hours, it can be Over or Under
- Billable Utilization:Â The percentage of billable hours worked against the total hours worked, indicating efficiency in generating revenue.
- Non-Billable Utilization: The percentage of non-billable hours to total hours, offering insights into time spent on internal or non-revenue-generating activities.
